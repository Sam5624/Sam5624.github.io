GitHub Pages

Ayo thanks github for letting me make a page. Just bored so yeah why not I guess.

Anyway, y'all can take what you like, its not as if its anything past Web 1.0 anyway. If you like the EXTREMELY BASIC layour just fork it and make it your own idk. You can probably tell I'm not an avid GitHub user.
